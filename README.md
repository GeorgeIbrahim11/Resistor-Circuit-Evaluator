# Resistor Circuit Evaluator

A C++ program that calculates total resistance in mixed series and parallel resistor circuits, based on a structured text input format.

## Features
- Supports nested `S` (series) and `P` (parallel) combinations
- Handles invalid inputs and edge cases
- Uses recursive parsing to evaluate the circuit
